Although, plugging in code and it magically working would have been cool too

<@200128384632750080> Perhaps one day someone will build AI that will allow you to type in, "generate me a cool game that will make me billions of dollars". In the meantime, all effort you put out in learning gameplay and shader programming will provide endless dividends.

Great resources.
These can work. If modifying the terrain itself, it will be a bit more complicated and require care around our existing code, but possible. The same concept will work.

oh for sure I am making a ski game and got pretty nice movement so far just starting to learn environmental stuff like shaders. Been grinding out my free time the last 6 months. I enjoy the learning 🙂
