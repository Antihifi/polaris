> Make a custom shader, then look in vertex() where it sets the vertex to an invalid number VERTEX.x = 0./0.;. Edit the conditional above it to filter out vertices that are < 0 or > 256 for instance. It will still build collision and consume memory for 1024 x 1024 maps, but this will allow you to control the visual aspect until alternate region sizes are supported.
