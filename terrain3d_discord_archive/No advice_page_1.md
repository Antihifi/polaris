Hello, I was working on a 6 region map with LOD at 10, size at 64, and noticed that the terrain popping was super noticeable. Outside of the settings mentioned above, is there a way to reduce this? I'm worried because I have really simple textures and not a lot of blocking foliage in my designs. I wanted to use this to make cake like terrain structures. Should I reduce the map, make the terrain less sheer, or something else? Any advice on this is welcome
