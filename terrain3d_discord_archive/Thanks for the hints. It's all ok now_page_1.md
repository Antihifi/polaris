Thanks for the hints. It's all ok now. The rotated node in the screenshot wasn't the culprit, this was only to see if it has an effect (which it hadn't) But even more awkward is that I had an unintenional rotation on the root node. Horror!! on a larger world. (Luckily it wasn't that hard to fix.)

<@979509375016263720> Great, looks neat. I'm making a games made with Terrain3D page, so let's add yours when you're ready with a game name, and one following link (steam, Twitter, website) dedicated to media for it.
